## Security Note:
### This code is by <ins>*NO MEANS secure WHATSOEVER*</ins>. 
*NO* traffic is encrypted, uses very arbitrary English-language keywords for networking, and no certification that the server or client is the same code from this repository.

Additionally, this game uses pickle, which has it's own [security issues.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

I wrote this as a school project to learn the basics of programming networked software and is very limited in what it can do. Please, for your own sanity, don't use it.
